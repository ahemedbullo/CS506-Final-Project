# **Stock Analysis and S&P 500 Trend Prediction**  

## Project Description
In this project, we're focusing on analyzing the relationship between the performance of individual stocks and the S&P 500 index to identify the most influential stocks on overall market trends. Specifically, we will calculate correlations between daily percentage changes in individual stocks and the S&P 500, then build a linear regression model to predict S&P 500 percentage change using the correlated stocks.

## Project Goals
- Analyze correlations between major stocks and the S&P 500 index
- Identify which stocks are leading indicators for market movements
- Create a predictive model for market trends based on key stock behavior

## Data Collection  
- Dataset will include historical stock data for companies in the S&P 500, including daily price changes and percentage changes.
- Key stocks (e.g., MSFT, TSLA, NVDA) and the S&P 500 index data will be included.
- Data will be collected from publicly available sources/datasets

## Data Cleaning and Feature Extraction  
- Remove missing values and outliers
- Handle stock splits and adjustments
- Calculate daily returns
- Standardize all features for consistency

## Modeling Approach
- We'll use statistical methods and machine learning techniques such as correlation analysis and linear regression.
- Understand how individual stocks affect the overall index performance
- Predict S&P 500 movement based on the performance of top stocks.

## Data Visualization  
- **Time Series Plot**: Display trends in S&P 500 and individual stocks over time.  
  

## Test Plan 
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Measure the model's accuracy and performance
- Evaluate on multiple market conditions
